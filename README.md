# Analyzing Historical Stock Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard

---

### Python Project for Data Science: Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard

- **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**
- **Daniel Alejandro Castillo Martín**

This project demonstrates how to extract, clean, and visualize historical stock and revenue data using Python. The analysis focuses on Tesla and GameStop, utilizing libraries such as `yfinance`, `pandas`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `plotly` to build interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Project Overview

The notebook in this repository guides you through:

- Extracting stock price data using the `yfinance` API.
- Web scraping revenue data from public sources using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Visualizing stock prices and revenue trends with interactive Plotly graphs.
- Building a simple dashboard to compare historical performance.

> *Note*: The original exercise firstly involved GameStop stock along with Tesla's, but GameStop was delisted so it was updated to NVIDIA Corporation (NVDG) in some versions.
